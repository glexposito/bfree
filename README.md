# bfree ✨

A better and beautiful `free`, in the spirit of tools like `btop`.
`bfree` is just starting out, but the goal is clear: a fast, elegant, zero-cost TUI you’ll actually enjoy running.

The command nobody asked for — but your RAM deserves it. 🚀


## Highlights

- 🧼 **Clean by design** — minimal, focused, and pleasant to read.
- ⚡ **Snappy TUI** — built with `ratatui` + `crossterm`.
- 🌱 **Early stage** — small now, growing fast.

## Status

- ✅ Hello screen placeholder
- 🔜 Real data, panels, and layout

## Run

```bash
cargo run
```

## Roadmap (short and sweet)

- ✅ Basic free reimplementation
- 📊 Core panels and bars
- 🧩 Modular widgets

## Contributing

Ideas, feedback, and PRs are welcome. The project is young — jump in early and shape it.
