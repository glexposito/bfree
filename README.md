# bfree ✨

A beautiful, free terminal dashboard in the spirit of tools like `btop`.
`bfree` is just starting out, but the goal is clear: a fast, elegant, zero-cost TUI you will actually enjoy running.

> Better & beautiful free, — the **bfree** command. 🚀

## Highlights

- 🧼 **Clean by design** — minimal, focused, and pleasant to read.
- ⚡ **Snappy TUI** — built with `ratatui` + `crossterm`.
- 🌱 **Early stage** — small now, growing fast.

## Status

- 🔜 Real data, panels, and layout
